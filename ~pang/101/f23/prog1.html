Objectives:

Use your List ADT in an application.

<! ================================================================== >


<H3>
Description:
</H3>
Write a program that uses the List ADT to produce formatted text.
The program will be reading from stdin.
Input will consist of a filename that specifies the file containing text to be formatted.
This is followed by commands to either format the text or to exit the program.
Details below.
</H3>

<! --------------------------------->
<ul>

<li>
<strong>Sample Input:</strong> A sample command file named <a href="commands.in">commands.in</a> is provided.
Inside the <tt>commands.in</tt> file, it specifies the filename of the text to be formatted.
You will be reading contents of <tt>commands.in</tt> using stdin i.e.
the code will be ran using the command:
<tt>prog1 < commands.in</tt>

<li>
In the sample command file, you'll see the first line as <tt>test.in</tt>.
This specifies the filename that contains the text to be formatted.
Your program should use <tt>fopen</tt> to open this specified filename.
Words are sequentially read using <tt>fscanf</tt> from the opened file.
Once all words are processed, <tt>fclose</tt> ensures the file is properly closed.

<li>
Input text file consists of at least one line of words.
A word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, including punctuations and other special symbols, and white space (i.e., space character, newline character, and tabs) are word delimiters.

<li>
You can assume that inputs from the text file are well formed, however invalid commands may be given.
For example, the user might inadvertently have a typo when entering a command.
Your application need to handle that gracefully e.g. with an error message
and to prompt user for a valid command.

<li>
Subsequent lines in the sample command file are commands to format the contents of <tt>test.in</tt> in various ways.
<br>
<b>format F #</b> will write out the text using line widths of <b>#</b>
and justification of <b>F</b>.

<li>
You don't need to split or hyphenate words.
You can assume that there are no words that are longer than <b>#</b> characters.

<li>
You are required to implement <b>F = L</b> and <b>F = R</b> for left
and right justified text respectively.
You can also implement <b>F = C</b> to center the text on each line
for bonus points (5 points).
<br>
For the centering text command, when there's an odd number of whitespaces in a line, the extra whitespace should be placed on the right side.

<li>
Words in the output are separated by a single space.

<li>
Other commands that you need to handle are
<b>quit</b> or <b>exit</b> which will terminate the program.

<li>
<strong>Expected Output:</strong>
Given the input file <a href=test.in>test.in</a>,
executing the commands in <a href=commands.in>commands.in</a> should generate files named:
<a href="test.L70">test.L70</a>, <a href="test.R50">test.R50</a>, and <a href="test.C45">test.C45</a>.
Note that the output filenames are derived from the input filename.

<li>
<strong>Another Test:</strong>
Given the input file <a href=test.in>test.in</a>,
executing the commands in <a href=commands2.in>commands2.in</a> using this command:
<tt>prog1 < commands2.in > commands2.out</tt>. <br>
This command should generate a file named:
<a href="test.L30">test.L30</a>.
Also, you should see a file named:
<a href=commands2.out>commands2.out</a> that saved the outputs.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>: In your program, use fprintf to write outputs specifically to the file <tt>test.L30</tt>.
For messages or logs that you want to appear in <tt>commands2.out</tt>, use printf. 
<br>It's crucial to differentiate between these two functions to ensure outputs are written to the correct files.
</ul>
<li>
Files for this program:
The following files are provided to you, and should all be submitted
with your work.</li>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=./Makefile>Makefile</a>: You don't touch this file. Running make should
 produce an executable called prog1</li>
<li>
<a href=./List.h>List.h</a>: You don't touch this file. Same as Hwk1.  </li>
<li>
<a href=./List.c>List.c</a>: This is from your Hwk1. If you have not completed it
earlier, you'll need to complete it now.  It will also be needed in subsequent
assignments.</li>
<li>
<a href=./formatter.c>formatter.c</a>: This is where you write the application
code.
</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>
Grading:
</h3>

<ul>
<li>

<P>
<b>Rubric:</b>

<pre>
You start off with 100 points.
You lose credit for missing functionality, incorrect results,
poorly documented or formatted code, or not following instructions.
Particularly:

- test cases: 50 points, we have 5 test cases each has 10 points
- use of List ADT functions: 30 points.
- style and commenting 20 points
- Bonus points: Get 5 points by implementing F = C to center the text on each line

Below is a partial list:

- up to 10 points off for inadequate comments or hard-to-read code
- up to 10 points off for not following instructions
- up to 10 points off for special handling to grade your homework (usually
  because you did not check that it runs on the unix timeshare server first).
- functionality points depending on importance

Make sure you:
a.  include a Makefile, .c files, and .h file
b.  generate an executable file called <b>prog1</b> with your makefile
c.  have confirmed that it compiles and runs properly on unix.ucsc.edu
d.  followed the general instructions described in <a href=https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~pang/101/f23/overview.html>overview.html</a>

<h4>Who graded your assignment based on your last name :</h4>

</ul>

<h3>
Submission:
</h3>

<p>
Make sure that you've compiled and tested your code on the campus
unix timeshare before submitting.

<p>
Put your makefile and source files in a folder named <b>prog1</b>.

<li>
In the same directory where you have the <b>prog1</b> folder,
the following command will recursively archive the contents
of your prog1 folder into a file named prog1.zip
<br>
<tt>zip -r prog1.zip prog1</tt>

<li>
Submit prog1.zip on Canvas under Program 1.

<p>
You can submit as often as you want up until the deadline.
We will only look at your most recent submission.

<p>
Read the 
<a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~pang/101/f23/overview.html">
for instructions on how to submit your work.
