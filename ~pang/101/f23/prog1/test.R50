Lydia is dead. But they don't know this yet. 1977,
    May 3, six thirty in the morning, no one knows
   anything but this innocuous fact: Lydia is late
for breakfast. As always, next to her cereal bowl,
      her mother has placed a sharpened pencil and
    Lydia's physics homework, six problems flagged
 with small ticks. Driving to work, Lydia's father
nudges the dial toward WXKP, Northwest Ohio's Best
  News Source, vexed by the crackles of static. On
the stairs, Lydia's brother yawns, still twined in
the tail end of his dream. And in her chair in the
     corner of the kitchen, Lydia's sister hunches
    moon-eyed over her cornflakes, sucking them to
   pieces one by one, waiting for Lydia to appear.
It's she who says, at last, "Lydia's taking a long
                                      time today."
