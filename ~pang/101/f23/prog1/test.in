Lydia is dead.
But they don't know this yet.
1977, May 3, six thirty in the morning,
no
one	knows anything but this innocuous fact: Lydia is late for breakfast.
As always, next to her cereal bowl, her mother has placed a sharpened
pencil and 	Lydia's physics    homework, six problems flagged with small ticks.
Driving to	 work, Lydia's    father nudges the dial toward WXKP, Northwest
Ohio's Best News Source, vexed by the crackles of static. On the stairs,
Lydia's brother 	 yawns, still twined in the tail end of his dream. And in her
chair in the corner of the kitchen, Lydia's sister hunches moon-eyed over her
cornflakes, sucking them to pieces one by one, waiting for Lydia to appear.
It's she who says, at last, "Lydia's taking a long time today."
