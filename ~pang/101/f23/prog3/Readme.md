## Homework: Music Database Manager

### Objective:
To create a program that allows users to manage a music database with functionalities such as adding, removing, updating, finding, and displaying songs.

### Description:

You are tasked with developing a simple music database management application using your `Dictionary.c` and the provided header file `Dictionary.h`.

Your application should provide the following functionalities:
1. **Add a Song**: This allows users to input a song name and its corresponding author.
2. **Remove a Song**: This enables users to delete a song from the database using the song's name.
3. **Update Song Details**: This lets users update the author of a song using the song's name.
4. **Find a Song**: This allows users to find a song in the database using the song's name.
5. **Display All Songs**: This will print out all the songs and their authors in the database.
6. **Exit**: This will terminate the program.

### Requirements:

1. Use the `Dictionary` data structure to store songs and their authors.
2. Ensure that all functions in `Dictionary.c` are tested and utilized.
3. Handle potential errors gracefully such as trying to remove a song that doesn't exist.
4. Ensure that the program continues running until the user chooses to exit.
