    <li><b>Dec 1, 2023:</b>Bonus challenge has been changed to a easier one. You don't need to do this if you have finished the previous one.</li>
    <li><b>Nov 28, 2023:</b>Clarifications: For queue, you can set its capacity to the number of cities. In C, you can use INT_MAX to present the maximum integer. </li>

    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
        In this assignment, you will delve into graph traversal algorithms by implementing two fundamental algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm. Your task is to apply these algorithms to a network of cities connected by railways to determine the shortest travel times under different constraints.
    </p>
    <h3>Problem Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Consider a set of `N` cities, numbered from `0` to `N-1`, interconnected by railways. The connections between cities are given as triples in the form `(u, v, w)`, where `u` is the starting city, `v` is the destination city, and `w` is the travel time in hours from city `u` to city `v`. Here are your tasks:
    </p>
    <h3>Tasks:</h3>
    <h4>Task 1: Uniform Travel Time with BFS</h4>
    <p>
        Assume the travel time between any two directly connected cities is uniform (1 hour), employ the BFS algorithm to calculate the minimum time required for a traveler to reach city `N-1` from city `0`.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Objective: </strong> Implement the BFS algorithm to determine the shortest path in terms of the number of cities traversed.
    </p>
    <h4>Task 2: Varied Travel Time with Dijkstra's Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
        Now, consider the actual travel times `w` between cities. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the minimum travel time needed for a traveler to go from city `0` to city `N-1`.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Objective: </strong>Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in terms of travel time.
        <br>
	Note: You can either use array or heap to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
    </p>

<h4>Bonus Challenge</h4>
<p>
    Let's consider that each edge in the graph is directed. First, display the shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices. Following that, present the shortest distances from each vertex to vertex n-1. 
    The information needs to be presented as follows:
    <br><br>
    Vertex:[Vertex Index],Distance:[Distance Value]<br><br>
    If a vertex is not reachable from vertex 0, or if it's not possible to reach vertex n-1 from a given vertex, the distance should be displayed as -1.
</p>
    <h3>Input Example</h3>
    At the start, your application will read input from stdin, as we did in the previous homeworks.
    <p>
        The input file <a href="test1.in"><code>test1.in</code></a> is an example with the following sequence of instructions for the program:
    </p>
    <pre>
    city1.in
    0
    1
    3
    </pre>
    <p>
The first line specifies a filename that contains connections between cities.
    Subsequent numbers are commands for specific operations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>'0' instructs the program to perform the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm.</li>
        <li>'1' is a directive to run Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
	<li>'2' is a directive to run the bonus task. Example inputs can be found in test3.in.
        <li>'3' signals the program to terminate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
The <a href="city1.in"><code>city1.in</code></a> file details city connections and is structured as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    5
    6
    0,1,4
    0,2,2
    1,2,1
    1,3,10
    2,4,3
    3,4,1
    </pre>
    '5' indicates the total number of cities, '6' represents the number of links between them, and each line like '0,1,4' denotes a time of '4' between cities '0' and '1'.
    <p>
        The files <a href="queue.c">queue.c</a> and <a href="queue.h">queue.h</a> are supplied. The tasks include completing the <a href="bfs.c">bfs.c</a>, <a href="dijkstra.c">dijkstra.c</a>, and <a href="main.c">main.c</a> files as per the requirements dictated by the input files.
    </p>
