<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>

<UL>
There are 4 prerequisites for this course:
<ul>
<li>
<a href=https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse13e>
CSE 13E</a> or
<a href=https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse13s>
CSE 13S</a> or
<a href=https://courses.engineering.ucsc.edu/courses/ece13>
ECE 13</a>.
This prerequisite is needed because
<b>we will be using the C programming language.</b>
<li>
<a href=https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse16>
CSE 16</a>
for background on sets, graphs, proofs, etc.
<li>
<a href=https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse30>
CSE 30</a> for some background on data structures, etc., and
<li>
some background on Calculus from one of the following courses:
MATH 11B, MATH 19B, MATH 20B, AM 11B.
</ul>
</ul>

<! -------------------------------------------------------- >
<p>
<b>Learning Objectives:</b>
<p>

Learn about and use data structures and appropriate algorithms
for interesting and practical problems.

<ul>

<li>
This class will be conducted in-person.
We have both in-person and remote TA-led lab sections.

<li>
There's no final exam!
There are no midterms.
Grading will be based primarily on assignments and quizzes.

<li>
<b>Assignments:</b>
There will be 6 programming assignments and 5 homework assignments.
There is one due per week, and more or less in alternate weeks.

<br>
<i>Homeworks</i>
are fairly low value exercises that are meant to 
be short, supportive components for your programming assignments, or
something to help address common questions raised during class, or to reinforce something that
might be important.
They might also be part of a larger programming assignment that's
split into two pieces.
The 5 homeworks together account for 10% of your grade.
Each homework accounts for 2% of your grade.

<br>
<i>Programs</i>
There are 6 programs in all and they account for 60% of your grade.
Each program accounts for 10% of your grade.
The last program is due the morning of your final exam date.

<li>
<b>Quizzes:</b>
These take the place of traditional midterm and final exams.
There are more of them, but each one is shorter.
Expect around 5 quizzes roughly one every other week.
These will be held in class.
The duration of each quiz may vary from 30min to an hour.
They account for 30% of your grade.
Each quiz have equal weight.

<li>
<b>
THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES, HOMEWORKS, OR PROGRAMS.
</b>

<li>
<b>
THE ONLY VALID USE FOR INCOMPLETES IS IF YOU ARE DOING WELL IN THE COURSE,
BUT UNABLE TO CONTINUE (E.G.  HOSPITALIZATION).
</b>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Grading Scale:</b>
<p>

We have two options for mapping numeric scores to letter grades.
The <b>default</b> grading scale which does not take into account how the
rest of the class performs is listed below.
Grades are rounded to nearest hundredths.
The <b>default</b> grading scale is as follows:

<tt>
<pre>
A+ = 100-97.00%
A  = 96.99-93%
A- = 92.99-90%
B+ = 89.99-87% 
B  = 86.99-83% 
B- = 82.99-80%
C+ = 79.99-77%
C  = 76.99-70%  
D  = 69.99-60%  
F  = 59.99-0%
</pre>
</tt>

Note: If you elected for P/NP,
<a
href=https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Undergraduate-Information/Undergraduate-Academic-Program/Evaluating-Academic-Performance/Pass-No-Pass-Option>
you need to have a C or better to earn a P.</a>

<p>
Note also that while D is considered passing,
<a href=https://registrar.ucsc.edu/navigator/section4/index.html#:~:text=The%20final%20letter%20grades%20for,)%2C%20F%20(fail)>
it cannot satisfy a prerequisite for another course</a>.

<p>
The other option, which the 
<a href=fall21.html>Fall 2021</a> class voted for (simple majority),
is to curve the grades.
The mapping is actually pretty close to the default one,
but may vary from one quarter to another as it would depend on how the class performed.

<p>
<b>Attendance:</b>
<p>

Attendance in the labs is required.
You are responsible for materials covered in the lecture and the labs.
Quizzes are held during lecture hours.

<p>
<b>Office Hour:</b>
<p>

A note about my office hours:
office hours end if/when there is no one else waiting to talk to me unless you let me know in
advance that you need to come later.
Send me an email to schedule something else if you can't make it during
my regular office hours.

<p>
<b>General Policies:</b>
<p>

All course work are intended as individual effort
(unless explicitly mentioned otherwise) and are graded as such.
It is okay to discuss general approaches and algorithms with
other students, but this should be done without writing, looking,
or sharing code.
Code found on the web, code generated by LLM or other means, etc.
are not your own code.  Submitting such code as your own work is
considered cheating.
<b>
Cheating or plagiarism in any form will not be tolerated.
</b>
Cheating is an automatic fail.
Here's how much a fail potentially 
<a href=https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/cost-to-attend/undergraduate-costs.html>
costs in dollars</a>.
Aside from academic sanctions,
additional disciplinary sanctions may apply if this
is not your first offense.
Punishment will match severity of offense.
(There has been at least one instance where a student was expelled
even though it was a first offense!)
You are responsible for protecting your solutions and programs
from being copied by others.
Refer to the 
<a href=https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html>
Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.</a>
If anything is not clear, ask me.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
<p>

Before you submit your work,
make sure that your program compiles and runs on the campus server machines
e.g. <tt>unix.ucsc.edu</tt>.
This is the environment where your code will be recompiled and tested!

<p>
<b>Submitting your work:</b>
<p>

Each programming assignment should be placed in its own folder.
The folder should contain a makefile and necessary .h and .c files.
Your code should have proper documentation
including comment blocks for each function, and inline comments as appropriate.
Code should be formatted so that it is easy for humans to read.
<p>
You can re-submit as often as you want.
We will only grade the most recent submission.

<p>
<b>DRC Accommodation:</b>
<p>

If you need accommodation, please contact me as soon as possible
since we'll need to request room/proctor in advance.
Be sure to provide the proper authorization letter.

<p>
<b>Transfer Students:</b>
<p>
Welcome to UCSC!  We are thrilled to have you here.  We recognize that transfer students have a
unique experience and in addition to the regular coursework may have other challenges
associated with starting off at UCSC as a new student.  Please don't hesitate to reach out
to me or to the TAs for help.  We all want you to be successful and look forward to your
unique contributions to our learning community
(welcome message adopted from Dr. Dunkin's message).
