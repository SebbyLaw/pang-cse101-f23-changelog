<b>Dec 07, 2023:</b>
We'll have 7 problems for the finals.  There's 5 point bonus if you get all the problems.
Questions will be mix of coding, understanding, and knowledge.
Make sure you are familiar with the different algorithms covered in class.  
Time allocation for the finals is 70 minutes.
This is a time-limited test i.e. some of you may not finish the exam in the allotted time.
Be strategic.  Apply a greedy algorithm to maximize your grade based on what you feel
confident most.

We will have problems on the following topics:
<pre>
1.  recursion
2.  doubly linked list
3.  priority queue
4.  binary search trees
5.  bfs and dfs
6.  mst
7.  avl
</pre>
Today's lecture on AVL was rushed.  If you have not done so, make sure you watch the
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDM6_TnYIqE&ab_channel=AbdulBari>
video link</a> that's in our links to online references page.
About 30 minutes if play back at 1.5x speed.

Student Experience of Teaching Surveys (SETS) are open and will close on Sunday,
December 10, 2023 11:59 PM.
Please fill up the survey.

<p>
<li>
<b>Dec 05, 2023:</b>
In case you were not in class today,
the class voted on:
(1) modified breakdown of grades -- see below.
(2) grade on a curve instead of default grading scale.
<br>
<pre>
Modified grading scale:
1.  programs  5 9% each = 45%
2.  homeworks 4 2% each =  8%
3.  writeup             =  7%
4.  quizzes   5 5% each = 25%
5.  exercises           =  5%   (plus max 2.5% bonus)
6.  finals              = 10%
</pre>

<p>
<li>
<b>Dec 05, 2023:</b>
Details on the requirements for the writeup above (7%).
Pick any 7 of your programming or homework assignments
and write your retrospection on each one.  I want this
to be a learning experience.  Write about what mistakes
you made, how you would do things differently, etc.  If
you already got full credit, think about how you could
enhance the program e.g. potential things for bonus credit.
Have at least one thoughtful paragraph per assignment.
Submit this on Canvas by midnight Dec 10, 2023.
