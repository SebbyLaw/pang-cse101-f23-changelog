Objectives:
</H3>

Brush up on C and 
<a href=
https://tenor.com/view/recursion-winnie-pooh-gif-8467721>recursion</a>.
You will also need to brush up a bit on geometry (lines and slopes)
and learn a bit of computer graphics along the way.

Description:
</H3>

In this programming assignment, you will be generating graphics patterns procedurally.
Specifically, you will be writing code to draw recursively defined shapes
known as
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_C_curve>
Levy C fractal curve.</a>
<br>

<H3>
Details:
</H3>
<ul>

<! --------------------------------->

<li>
You will read from stdin, which you can redirect from a file.
Input will consist of:
<ul>
<li> output filename - string with no spae,
<li> dimension of image - 2 integers,
representing width (number of columns) and height (number of rows)
respectively.
Coordinates of points on the image are 0..W-1, 0..H-1.
The origin is at the top left corner.
<li> recursive depth - an integer,
<li> starting point - 2 doubles (x and y coordinates),
<li> ending point - 2 doubles (x and y coordinates).
</ul>

<li>
In the following examples, input/output pairs are:
<ul>
<li> out1 512 512 10 250 370 370.0 250.0
	<br>
	will produce the following image in a file called <t>out1.png</t>
	<br>
	<IMG SRC="out1.png" width = 150> <br> </a>
<li> out2 512 512 5 150.0 360.0 360.0 360.0
	<br>
	will produce the following image in a file called <t>out2.png</t>
	<br>
	<IMG SRC="out2.png" width = 150> <br> </a>
<li> Note that the order of points matter.  Compare this with the first
example:
	<br>
	out3 512 512 10 370 250 250 370
	<br>
	will produce the following image in a file called <t>out3.png</t>
	<br>
	<IMG SRC="out3.png" width = 150> <br> </a>
<li> If parts of the C curve falls outside the drawing area,
those parts are drawn but are not visible.  You don't need to do anything
special in your code sine Cairo will handle it for you.
	<br>
	out4 256 256 8 128 128 250 128
	will produce the following image in a file called <t>out4.png</t>
	<br>
	<IMG SRC="out4.png" width = 150> <br> </a>

<li>
<b>Requirements:</b>
<ul>
	<li> In addition to handling the input specifications mentioned above, your output
		should consist of a solid background color, and a solid foreground color (for drawing your boxes).
		The examples above use a white background and a red foreground color.
		You can change these two colors, but please pick a pair that are easy to see.
	<li> Each run of your code should produce a png file.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
<b>Graphics Library:</b>
There's only a limited number of free simple 2D graphics library with C binding.
For this programming assignment, we will use the
<a href=https://www.cairographics.org/>
Cairo Graphics Library</a>.
It's easy to learn the basics needed for this assignment
and it also supports multiple output "targets".
For this assignment, your program will output images in png format.
It also runs on multiple platform: Unix, Windows, Mac.
<p>
The Cairo Graphics Library is already installed on our campus unix webserver: <tt>unix.ucsc.edu</tt>.
Please make sure that your code compiles, runs, and produces the correct output on this
server before submitting your code.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Tutorial/Startup code:</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href=https://www.cairographics.org/tutorial/>Cairo Tutorial</a> is a nice concise tutorial.
<br>
The coordinate system in Cairo graphics
has x increasing going to the right,
and y increasing going down!
When we do arithmetic, we usually think of y increasing going up.
You can convert Cairo y-coordinates to the standard y-coordinates
by simply multiplying them by minus 1.
After doing your arithmetic, be sure to convert back to Cairo y-coordinates
before sending the draw commands.

<li> <a href=Makefile>Makefile</a>
<br>
Note that the source and executable files are named
<tt>ccurve.c</tt> and
<tt>ccurve</tt> respectively.
<li> <a href=square.c>Startup code</a> which produces the following output:
	<IMG SRC="square.png" width = 150> <br> </a>

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<b>Input/Output:</b>
<ul>
<li>
You will be reading input to your program from stdin.
To run your code, we will be doing something like:
<br>
<tt>ccurve < input1.txt</tt>.
<li>
The input files will contain the input specs mentioned above prepended by an output filename.
Each input file will contain info for a single run.
For example, <tt>input1.txt</tt> might contain:
<br>
<tt>output1  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       512 512 10 250 370 370.0 250.0</tt>.
<br>
It should then generate <tt>output1.png</tt> which contains the output image of your run.
Use blank space character as delimiter for the filename.
</ul>

<h3>
Grading:
</h3>

<ul>
<li>

<P>
<b>Rubric:</b>

<pre>
We followed the following grading rubric:
*  15 points for proper comments and well written code
*  20 points for using recursion properly and correctly
*  5 points for following all the instructions
*  60 points for 6 test cases, 10 points per test case.
</pre>
<!-- You start off with 100 points.
You lose credit for missing functionality, incorrect results,
poorly documented or formatted code, or not following instructions.

Below is a partial list:

- up to 10 points off for inadequate comments or hard-to-read code
- up to 10 points off for special handling to grade your homework
  (usually because you did not check that it runs on the computers in the lab first)
- up to 10 points off for not following instructions
- functionality points depending on importance
	*  20 points off if not using recursion
	*  10 points off if failed a test (we have 6 test input) -->



<!-- Make sure you:
a.  include a makefile, .c file, and optionally .h file
b.  generate an executable file called <b>ccurve</b> with your makefile
c.  have confirmed that it compiles and runs properly on unix.ucsc.edu
d.  followed the general instructions described in <a href=https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~pang/101/f23/overview.html>overview.html</a> -->

<h3>
Submission:
</h3>

<p>
Make sure that you've compiled and tested your code on the campus
unix timeshare before submitting.

Put your makefile and source files in a folder named <b>prog0</b>.

<li>
In the same directory where you have the <b>prog0</b> folder,
the following command will recursively archive the contents
of your prog0 folder into a file named prog0.zip
<br>
<tt>zip -r prog0.zip prog0</tt>

<li>
Submit prog0.zip on Canvas under Program 0.

<p>
You can submit as often as you want up until the deadline.
We will only look at your most recent submission.
