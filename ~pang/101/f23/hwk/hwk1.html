<h3>
Objectives:
</h3>

Implement the List ADT and a write test code.

<h3>
Description:
</h3>

In this assignment you will implement a List ADT and write test code to verify that your List ADT works as expected.

<h3>
Details:
</h3>
<ul>

<li>
You are provided with stubs for the List ADT in 
<a href=List.h>List.h</a>.
This file contains functions that the List ADT need to support.
Do not edit this file.

<p>
<li>
The function headers may look overly complicated but that's because
it's designed to support Lists of different data types.
Note that (void *) can be cast to the appropriate data type needed by your application.
Also, functions are being passed as parameters.
This is likely a new concept for most of you.
Here's a link that explains this concept with some

<! a href=https://jraleman.medium.com/c-programming-language-passing-a-function-as-a-parameter-90d52fe842ea>
examples</a>.

<p>
<li>
There are 2 main task for this homework:
<ul>

<p>
<li>
Implement the functions specified in List.h.
You will write your code for that in <a href=List.c>List.c</a>.

<p>
<li>
Test your List ADT.

<ul>
<li>
An application code is provided to help you verify your implementation
of the functions of this List ADT.
There are a couple of questions in the code that you should answer for yourself.
In addition,
you should add additional test for the <tt>deleteList</tt> function.
<li>
The expected output for the starter test code
<a href=hwk1.c>hwk1.c</a> is in
<a href=hwk1.out>hwk1.out</a>.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
<li>
Files for this program:
The following files are provided to you, and should all be submitted
with your work.
<ul>

<p>
<li>
<a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>: Makefile for compiling your code.

<p>
<li>
<a href="List.h">List.h</a>: Do not change this file. It has a list of
functions that you need to implement for the List ADT

<p>
<li>
  <a href="List.c">List.c</a>: This is where you implement your List ADT.

<p>
<li>
<a href="hwk1.c">hwk1.c</a>: This is where you put your client app.


</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>
Rubrics:
</h3>

<pre>
You start off with 100 points.
You lose credit for missing functionality, incorrect results,
poorly documented or formatted code, or not following instructions.

Breakdown:

- attempted implementation for each function (10 points each, total 70).
- code documentation (10 points)
- extra test added to hwk1.c (10 points)
- following submission instructions (10 points)
</pre>

<h3>
Submission:
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Aside from comparing your output with those in <a href=hwk1.out>hwk1.out</a>,
be sure to do <b>unit testing</b> of your code.

<li>
<p>
Make sure that you've compiled and tested your code on the campus
unix timeshare before submitting.  On the unix timeshare,
put materials in a folder named <b>hwk1</b>.

<li>
In the same directory where you have the <b>hwk1</b> folder,
the following command will recursively archive the contents
of your hwk1 folder into a file named hwk1.zip
<br>
<tt>zip -r hwk1.zip hwk1</tt>

<li>
Submit hwk1.zip on Canvas under Homework 1.

<p>
Put your makefile and source files in a folder named <b>hwk1</b>.

<p>
You can submit as often as you want up until the deadline.
We will only look at your most recent submission.

</ul>
