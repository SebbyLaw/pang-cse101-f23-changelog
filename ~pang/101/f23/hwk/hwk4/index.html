Changelog:
</H3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Nov 09, 2023:</b> hwk4.c was created. Initial release of homework files. </li>
    <li><b>Nov 11, 2023:</b> hwk4.c released completely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Objectives:
</h3>

Develop a binary search tree (BST) from a sorted array and implement various traversal methods along with insertion and deletion operations.

<h3>
Description:
</h3>

In this assignment, you will implement a binary search tree (BST) and develop an application to manage and manipulate the tree.

<h3>
Details:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Your application will begin by reading the number of elements in a sorted array and the sorted array itself from stdin. These will be used to generate the initial binary search tree.
</li>
<li>
The first line read from stdin will represent the number of elements in the sorted array, and the second line will contain the elements of the sorted array itself.
</li>
<li>
After the tree has been initialized, your application should support the following functionalities, executed according to the index of commands from stdin:
<ol>

<li>Insert a Node: Add a new node with a specified value to the BST.</li>
<li>Delete a Node: Remove a node with a specified value from the BST.</li>
<li>Find a Node: Search for a node with a specified value and return its details.</li>
<li>Inorder Traversal: Traverse and display the BST in an inorder manner.</li>
<li>Preorder Traversal: Traverse and display the BST in a preorder manner.</li>
<li>Postorder Traversal: Traverse and display the BST in a postorder manner.</li>
<li>Exit: Terminate the application.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Files for this program:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>: Makefile for compiling your code.
</li>
<li>
<a href="BST.h">BST.h</a>: Header file containing the structure of the BST and the prototypes of the functions you need to implement.
</li>
<li>
<a href="BST.c">BST.c</a>: This is where you implement your binary search tree and its functionalities.
</li>
<li>
<a href="hwk4.c">hwk4.c</a>: This is the main application file where you will handle user inputs and call the corresponding BST functions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Input and Output Files:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="test1.in">test1.in</a>: This file contains the sorted array followed by commands for stdin. The first line specifies the number of elements, and the second line lists the elements themselves.
</li>
<li>
<a href="test1.out">test1.out</a>: This is the expected standard output file based on the operations performed in test1.in.
</li>
<li>
<a href="test2.in">test2.in</a>: Similar to test1.in, this file contains a sorted array and a set of commands.
</li>
<li>
<a href="test2.out">test2.out</a>: This is the expected standard output file based on the operations performed in test2.in.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>
Rubrics:
</h3>
<pre>
You start off with 100 points.
You lose credit for missing functionality, incorrect results,
poorly documented or formatted code, or not following instructions.

Breakdown:
- Construct BST from sorted array (10 points)
- Each traversal implementation (inorder, preorder, postorder) (10 points each, total 30 points)
- Correct insert, find, and delete node functions (30 points)
- Application functionality according to user commands (10 points)
- Code documentation (10 points)
- Following submission instructions (10 points)
</pre>

<p>
<h3>
Submission:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Your application should read input from stdin and output results to stdout.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that your code compiles and runs as expected on the campus unix timeshare. Place your materials in a folder named <b>hwk4</b>.
</li>
<li>
To submit, archive your <b>hwk4</b> folder into hwk4.zip using the following command:
<br>
<tt>zip -r hwk4.zip hwk4</tt>
</li>
<li>
Submit hwk4.zip on Canvas under Homework 4.
</li>
<li>
Include your Makefile and source files in the <b>hwk4</b> folder and submit before the deadline. Late submissions will not be graded.
</li>
</ul>
