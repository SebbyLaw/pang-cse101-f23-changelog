Description:
</H3>

<ul>

<li>
Login to the campus unix timeshare remotely.
The unix server is called:
<b>unix.ucsc.edu</b>.
If you stil don't have one, make sure you create one asap!
Here's some 
<A href=https://its.ucsc.edu/unix-timeshare/tutorials/how-to-connect.html>
info</a> on how to login to the unix timeshare.

<li>
Create a file on where you normally write code e.g. your home
PC or Mac.
The file can contain anything
e.g. a joke, some code from simple C code, whatever.
You can also login to unix.ucsc.edu and create these files there instead.

<li>
To transfer files to/from the unix timeshare,
some tools are 
ssh
and
<a href=https://filezilla-project.org/>
filezilla</a>.

<li>
Put your file in a folder named hwk0.

<li>
In the same directory where you have the hwk0 folder,
the following command will recursively archive the contents
of your hwk0 folder into a file named hwk0.zip
<br>
<tt>zip -r hwk0.zip hwk0</tt>

<li>
Submit hwk0.zip on Canvas under Homework 0.

<li>
You can submit multiple times.
We will only grade the last one.

</ul>
