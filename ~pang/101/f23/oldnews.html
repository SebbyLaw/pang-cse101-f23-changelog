<b>Nov 28, 2023:</b>
Here's the deadline I gave to our TA/graders:
pgm2, hwk2, pgm3, and hwk4 grades should be ready by this Friday morning.
They will be entered to Canvas as they are graded rather than posted all
at once.  So, if your grade appears ungraded before then, please be patient
a bit longer.

<p>

<b>Nov 28, 2023:</b>
I need to cover graphs in lecture for program 4.
So for Thursday, we'll talk about graphs first and move the discussion
for tree balancing to next week.  Please read ahead on Sections 20.2, 20.3, 21, 22.3

<b>Nov 28, 2023:</b>
Slight correction to note of Nov 21.  Since the context is for node deletion,
we don't actually need the successor (which could be an ancestor
of the node to be deleted), instead we just need the minimum of the right subtree
(textbook).  Or the maximum of the left subtree (algorithm animation link).

<p>
<li>
<b>Nov 21, 2023:</b>
Note: When deleting a node which has 2 children, you can either
replace it with its successor (textbook), or its predecessor (algorithm animation link).
Note that the successor node does not have a left child.  Likewise the predecessor node
does not have a right child.

<p>
<li>
<b>Nov 21, 2023:</b>
Note: the deadlines for Hwk4 and Pgm4 are midnight Tuesdays.

<b>Nov 7, 2023:</b>
Friday is Veterans day and is observed by the university.
So, no TA section for friday.

<p>
<li>
<b>Nov 2, 2023:</b>
Regarding lecture and TA exercises,
I plan to assign 1 point for each of these exercise.
We'll then sum them up and divide by the number of exercises
that were handed out.  If you attend more than 1 TA section,
and do all the exercises, you could potentially get over 100%
Submissions are on paper/pencil only.  Be sure to bring them
for each meeting.

<p>
<li>
<b>Oct 31, 2023:</b>
As mentioned in class, we will start to have in-class exercises
for discussion and submission.
We will also be doing similar exercises in the TA sections.
Be sure to attend both lectures and TA sections.
Current plan is to collect all these exercises and together
make them count as a quiz.
So instead of 5 quizzes worth 6% each.
We will have 6 quizzes worth 5% each.
This should increase your quiz average,
but more importantly improve your quiz performance going forward.
